I have been extremely blessed to work with some incredibly awesome and talented people so early in my career. My advice for anyone getting started in technology is to find a non-proft organization and volunteer your time and energy into making cool things. 

Learning to do big things with little to no resources is an incredible challenge and forces you to think outside the box. You will make mistakes and you will learn from them!

Below, you will find my education and some of the projects I have been involved with that have been fundamental in developing my experience in the field of client and server side technologies. Enjoy!
