I volunteered for Bayside in Galt for just under seven years in various capacities in the areas of audiovisual and system administration.


My audiovisual experience at Bayside primarily focuses on setting up and maintaining a Behringer X32 based system. The system we utilized was migrated from an analog board and traditional snake to the new AES50 networking standard. Bayside's configuration encompassed a large array of vocals and instruments such as violin, cello, electric guitar, acoustic, congas, chimes, and multi-drum setups requiring the use of various digital plugins.


My server administration experience at Bayside started with hosting of the Bayside website. The website, which started on the WordPress platform, was hosted on a LNMP stack which required the configuration of NGINX and MariaDB. I also aided in optimizing Bayside's website performance and helped the organization adopt CloudFlare, which provides global CDN and DNS services.


As the organization grew and moved into its first permanent building, the need for a network infrastructure grew. I was charged with procuring and managing various network technologies from vendors such as MicroTik, HP, Cisco, Ubiquiti, pfSense, and OPNsense. During my time at Bayside, the network was logically laid out in VLANs and had strict security and access controls to enable remote access to services such as printing and sound management. With the need for network infrastructure, the organization also required a PBX system which involved a fully developed IVR and hunt groups.


My desire for Bayside was to assist in the development of the organization's use of modern network infrastructure to provide a performant and reliable network so that the organization could increase its outreach to the local community. Bayside provided a great experience for me and taught me that a little can go a long way.
