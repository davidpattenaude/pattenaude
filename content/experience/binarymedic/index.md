My first computer was the family's 15" Toshiba Satalite that was powered by Windows Vista. I remember the computer having to be frequently serviced due to the number of viruses my siblings introduced to the device. Servicing the laptop always costed an arm and a leg, it frequently included marketing for expensive antivirus software, and did not provide enough education on how to avoid re-infecting the machine. 


These interactions shaped my want to learn how to fix and maintain computers to avoid ever having to pay someone else to work on my device again, but also left a sour taste in how these services are offered to consumers who do not know what is being pushed on them.


This realization and determination allowed me to start my own computer repair business, BinaryMedic, which served the Sacramento and San Joaquin area and provided affordable yet high quality services. 


I provided services such as data recovery, hardware replacement, PC building and procurement, and other basic services such as virus removal and configurations.


One thing I was proud of with BinaryMedic is the amount of education I was able to provide users on maintaining their devices and reducing repairs in the long-haul. I strived and focused on this business practice. While this ideology does not align well with the industry standard that banks on consumers returning for repairs in a couple of weeks, it develops long-lasting and happy clients.
