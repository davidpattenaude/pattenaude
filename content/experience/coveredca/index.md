I work on the service desk at Covered California as a student contractor. I provide support services for the organization in both remote and face-to-face modalities. 

My everyday responsibilities include:
- User and  workstation management with utilities such as:
    -  Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager, Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, and PowerShell. 
- Experience in troubleshooting Palo Alto and Cisco VPN configurations.
- Heavy troubleshooting and coordination with different tiers of support and departments. 


I have also been given the responsibilities to work on and lead some larger projects within the organization.


The first project entailed developing a system that scaled across the organization for use in three separate locations. The project involved developing with utilities such as Docker, Rancher, and VMWare ESXi to enable quick scaling and portability. The project also included UNIX, shell scripting, and networking experience to fulfill the required project requirements. This project involved extensive coordination across the areas of infrastructure, security, and networking. 


The second project I was tasked with was to develop and test a new IVR and softphone solution that was built upon AWS connect for the service desk. The project involved extensive testing and documentation in development and the creation of a User Acceptance Testing plan to ensure the rollout and crossover were seamless and with minimal interruption.
